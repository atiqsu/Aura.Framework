(This list includes the changes from 1.0.0-beta5 and 6, which had problems with their composer.json files.)

- [NEW] Aura\Framework\Intl\Translator to implement a separated interface.

- [FIX] Make allowances for non-integer return codes in Bootstrap\Cli.

- [FIX] In Bootstrap\Factory, don't read the same $mode file twice. read 'default' then whatever the non-default mode is. closes #32. thanks @ammmze

- [FIX] In Bootstrap\Factory, instead of overriding the include path, prepend it with the system include directory

- [NEW] Test\WiringAssertionsTrait for wiring test assertions.
